D2X-Rebirth Changelog

20130611
--------
main/titles.c: Fixed briefing_screens array for Descent 1 Shareware
main/mission.c: Don't try to free Current_mission->alternate_ham_file if not allocated
main/menu.c: Changed message regarding VSync and Multisampling indicating not all OSes need a restart to apply (mysteries of SDL)
main/gamecntl.c: Fixed case where it wasn't possible to switch to view of a player > X if player X was missing
main/laser.c: Consider FrameTime overhead when calculating time to allow next weapon fire. Should work perfectly as long as FPS >= Shots-per-second. Also set Omega firing rate to 20 shots per second for both single- and multiplayer

20130610
--------
misc/hmp.c: Made hmp code actually read tempo. Due to missing documentation of the format I can only guess it's a 4 bit int
main/piggy.c: re-init digi system after re-setting sample rate for shareware
main/gameseq.c: Removed call of digi_stop_digi_sounds() from DoPlayerDead(). Since it was killing persistent sounds which were only started once a level it would forever mute fans, waterfalls, etc.. Also closing Game_wind kills all sounds anyways so there is no point doing it on player death

20130422
--------
main/net_udp.c: In restricted game mode check for player callsign and sockaddr at the same time; Clear Netgame struct each time player enters a new IP in manual join menu
arch/sdl/rbaudio.c: Added a lot of status messages for RBA code shown with -verbose, hopefully making it easier for users to track down problems and made all RBA messages start with RBAudio prefix

20130418
--------
main/lighting.c, main/render.c: Removed light_frame_count due to being unnecessary since lighting is now time-based and messed up deletion of dynamic light
main/render.c: Due to additive blending, transparent sprites will become invivible in font of white surfaces (lamps). Fix that with a little desaturation
main/net_udp.h: Made UPID_GAME_INFO_SIZE, UPID_GAME_INFO_LITE_SIZE and UPID_SEQUENCE_SIZE change if NETGAME_NAME_LEN, MISSION_NAME_LEN or CALLSIGN_LEN changes

20130408
--------
main/gamecntl.c, main/gamerend.c, main/gauges.c, main/gauges.h: Added 4th alternative HUD mode for no HUD rendering, aka Immersion mode
main/menu.c, main/playsave.c, main/playsave.h, main/weapons.c: Added option to ignore cycling weapons that are not on autoselect list

20130407

main/inferno.h, main/mission.c, main/mission.h: Increased the maximum number of levels and secret levels per mission to 127 each, using MALLOC'd arrays; defined 'd_fname' type (mainly for my pointers to arrays of 13 character filenames, but could be convenient elsewhere)
arch/carbon/messagebox.c, arch/win32/messagebox.c: If there's a messagebox to show on exit, and we *were* in fullscreen, don't try to toggle fullscreen and crash

20130108
--------
main/gamerend.c, main/multi.c, net_udp.c: Fixed some minor HUD-text related issues: For team assignment messages, joining player name would appear; team color assignment in netgame info screen could be wrong due to wrong syntax handling; when rewrapping text messages to specific player, game would not add space behind colon
main/kmatrix.c: Defer free of kmatrix data until window is fully gone - patch by Kp
main/inferno.c: Disable fullscreen toggling via ALT+ENTER if Game_wind is on top so toggling cannot be done accidentially ingame

main/multi.c, main/object.c: cleanly decide it to drop a hoard orb depending on wether we were killed by ourselves, en enemy or team-mate without any ugly and unreliable hacks
main/kconfig.c: Switching keyboard sensitivity function from variable increase to variable offset, making the ship more responsive in higher settings

main/multi.c: During kmatrix bring up Game_wind againso the host can still follow the game - becomes necessary later with host-authority functions

20120510
--------
main/multi.h, main/state.c: Reuse pre-defined player objects when loading coop savestate to revent messup when player amount or orders change in a certain way
main/menu.c, main/playsave.c, main/playsave.h, main/weapon.c: Wrote seperate function for weapon autocycling that also cycles through non-autoselect weapons and properly respects super laser; Added option to not autoselect weapon when firing; On the way, smoothed the menu text in misc menu a bit

20120424
--------
main/gauges.c: little reorganization for draw_hud(): draw multiplayer names first, reticle last to prevent anything being drawn over by floating names and reticle not messed by anything else

20120423
--------
main/multi.c, main/multi.h, main/net_udp.c: fixed improper player disconnecting which might have been caused by endlevel packet

20120422

20120417
--------
main/game.c: Make sure Cursegp is initialised if using it to set an object when loading a game (EDITOR build). Thought I already committed this
main/gameseq.c: Finish the game cleanly, closing Game_wind, if Current_level_num is 0
editor/med.c: Reset the player object for the editor, since demo playback mucks it up
main/render.c: Skip rendering of OBJ_NONE objects to avoid a failed Assert (can happen when playing a demo then going to the editor)
main/newdemo.c: Set object lifeleft to IMMORTAL_TIME if the byte read in demo playback is -1. This allows the objects to stay when playing a demo, going to the editor then playing the game from the editor
main/newdemo.c: Call free_mission() if a demo is corrupt, so the editor doesn't load a corrupt level
editor/group.c, editor/kgame.c, editor/khelp.c, editor/kmine.c, editor/macro.c, editor/med.c, editor/medwall.c, editor/mine.c, include/ui.h, ui/file.c, ui/keypad.c, ui/menubar.c, ui/message.c: Rename MessageBox to ui_messagebox to avoid a conflict with Windows' MessageBox
main/newdemo.c, main/object.c, main/object.h: Call new obj_relink_all after playing a demo, so the editor is (hopefully) never faced with poorly linked objects and hence crashes
editor/eglobal.c, editor/med.c, main/gamesave.c, main/menu.c, main/mission.c, main/mission.h: Make a new mission when making a new mine to avoid a crash when testing it straight from the editor and winning, only create a new mine if a mission isn't loaded, init Cursegp to NULL, remove key command for ToggleDrawAllSegments since add segment now has ctrl-A

20120416
--------
main/gameseq.c, main/multi.c, main/multi.h: fixed two bugs caused by recent Multiplayer cleanup: Set more player-death-related veriables outside of dead_player_end() when creating new ship as not covered in subfunction is Palyer_is_dead is not true; also init my own inventory properly in multi_prep_level to get our inventory straight after receiving netgame information
editor/data/med.mnu, editor/med.c, editor/medmisc.c, main/slew.c, ui/ui.c: Make movement in the editor's game screen use the player controls, make that movement more like the automap and resolve some likely conflicting key commands
editor/centers.c, editor/eswitch.c, editor/med.c, editor/medrobot.c, editor/medwall.c, main/game.c, main/gameseq.c: Avoid crashes when clicking on close box with a center, switch, object or wall editing dialog open; also when playing a level, going to the editor, going back to the game then dying

20120415
--------
main/multi.c, main/multi.h, main/net_udp.c: When possibly sending player positions prior to firing, do that before messing multibuf; Added more strict sanity checks for outgoing and incoming multi packets; Moved some general game stuff from net_udp_init() to multi_new_game()

2d/gpixel.c, arch/ogl/gr.c, editor/meddraw.c, include/ogl_init.h, main/multi.c, main/render.c: Clicking on mine elements in the editor now works in ogl
editor/centers.c: Create a centers dialog that won't crash
main/bmread.c, main/game.c, main/gameseq.c, main/gameseq.h, main/gauges.c, main/kmatrix.c, main/multi.c, main/multi.h, main/net_udp.c, main/state.c: Further Multiplayer cleanup: moved gobal variable resets from multi_new_game() to proper function calls; added pnum variable to init_player_stats_game() and init_player_stats_new_ship() so these can be set for each player when starting match; added multi_new_level() calls when setting up game as well when trying to join game; cleaned multi_reset_stuff() from variable resetting that happen in general game code; when being dumped from game, made sure no packets are sent during messagebox dispaly; replaced MAX_NUM_NET_PLAYERS by MAX_PLAYERS as it's the same definition
misc/hmp.c: Addition for last change in hmp_reset(): execute midiOutShortMsg() even if midiOutPrepareHeader() fails as not related to SysEx part
2d/bitblt.c, main/render.c: Fixed set but unused variables in OGL build

20120414
--------
main/gamesave.c: Fix crash when loading a level in the editor
editor/segment.c, include/editor/editor.h, main/gamesave.c: Set Gamesave_current_version to correct version when making a new mine, move create_new_mine to gamesave.c

editor/med.c, main/game.c, main/gamecntl.c: Delete-E while playing a level now works properly - it closes Game_wind and sets Cursegp if necessary when going to the editor
main/ai2.c: Fix crash when playing a level straight from the editor (check if Current_mission has actually been loaded, like the other ex-crash)
editor/med.c, main/dumpmine.c, main/gamecntl.c, ui/ui.c: Fix bugs switching between game and editor and back: make sure ModeFlag is set to 0 before it has any chance to show an alert message, fixing a crash; allow OBJ_NONE in Assert; make Game_wind invisible when loading editor in case we show an alert; call mouse_flush() in ui_init() to fix mouse issues
editor/med.c, main/gamesave.c: Set the correct palette for the editor
editor/meddraw.c: Set the correct edge colors for editor wireframe drawing (in LargeView)

20120412
--------
main/collide.c, main/gameseq.c, main/multi.c, main/multi.h, main/net_udp.c: Fixed some Multiplayer bugs: Reactor invulnerable time did not checked for hours spent in level so reactor would become invulnerable again after 60 minutes; Fixed the fix (heh) for misordered explode/reappear packets; Reset Player_eggs_dropped when initializing new ship so eggs are properly dropped when player disconnects two times without respawning; Cleaned player disconnecting a little bit and made code more straightforward
main/menu.c, misc/hmp.c: Removed redundant call of songs_stop_all() when starting credits; Added failsafe for loop in case MHDR_DONE flag is not properly set by MIDI device; Added more verbosity for hmp_reset()

20120411

--------
main/state.c: in software rendering scale savestate thumbnail to correct size
editor/autosave.c, editor/info.c, editor/med.c, editor/objpage.c, editor/texpage.c, include/ui.h, ui/keypad.c, ui/uidraw.c: Get the clock, 'keypad' info, texture choosing page and object choosing page to draw (latter two just show black squares for ogl)
arch/sdl/window.c, ui/menubar.c: Fix a nasty bug where pressing 'Alt' to explore the editor menubar would split the window stack in two, rendering the editor unresponsive
2d/bitblt.c, 2d/box.c, 2d/font.c, arch/ogl/gr.c, editor/med.c, ui/dialog.c, ui/uidraw.c, ui/userbox.c: Fix all remaining known editor drawing issues. In ogl: get the texture previews to draw, get userbox borders to draw in the right location, properly underline characters in the menus, draw all the borders properly (i.e. no gap), no scaling fonts. Software render: draw userbox borders again. Both: clear the whole status bar, clear to the right edge of the screen.
main/newmenu.c: No setting the screen mode when calling a newmenu function, so if it shows the 'Save Mine' messagebox in the editor, it won't change the screen resolution and trash everything. (If this causes problems, we can make it use the MessageBox if it's still in the editor, nm_messagebox otherwise)
2d/rect.c, editor/info.c, editor/med.c, include/ui.h, main/inferno.c, ui/dialog.c, ui/menubar.c: Editor exits cleanly when clicking the close box, no more redundant gr_uscanline call in gl_urect for ogl (an initial attempt to fix the previous bug)
2d/rect.c: Fix unused variable warning in last commit

20120408
--------
main/mission.c, main/mission.h, main/titles.c: added specification for Descent: Destination Saturn briefing screen to properly show briefings; added different briefing structure for Descent 1 Shareware which has a slightly different order of the usual briefings
main/collide.c: plasma fire can ignite bombs which are dropped while firing. to compensate added a timed check where at least one projectile must be older than 200ms to trigger a possible collision. this fixes this issue if the player is moving away from the bomb

20120407
--------
main/fireball.c: in choose_drop_segment let fallback correctly check for reactor segment
2d/font.c, main/piggy.c, misc/strutil.c: removed redundant definitions of FILENAME_LEN

20120405
--------
main/multi.c: variable declarations come first
include/maths.h, main/fvi.c, maths/fixc.c: Introduced fixmul64 returning fix64 type to use with check_point_to_face() and prevent fix overflow with very large faces; on the way cleaned up NO_FIX_INLINE remnants and replaced QLONG with fix64

20120331
--------
d2x-rebirth.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj, 2d/font.c: Make sure the ogl font code recognises the editor font is fixed width, fixing a crash; take the plunge and make D2X Rebirth compile with editor for Mac OpenGL build (won't work yet)
editor/med.c, editor/meddraw.c, editor/medmisc.c, include/editor/editor.h, main/render.c: Make all drawing in the editor single buffered, since the whole screen is double buffered. Fixes crash - but only shows a black screen and the menu for ogl
main/render.c: Complete previous change (whoops)
editor/med.c, editor/meddraw.c, editor/medmisc.c, ui/button.c, ui/checkbox.c, ui/dialog.c, ui/file.c, ui/icon.c, ui/inputbox.c, ui/listbox.c, ui/menubar.c, ui/radio.c, ui/scroll.c, ui/userbox.c: Make the main stuff (gadgets, two viewers) draw for the editor in ogl, still more tweaking required
ui/dialog.c: Use correct coordinates for dialog border (still doesn't draw fully)
editor/medmisc.c, ui/button.c, ui/checkbox.c, ui/icon.c, ui/inputbox.c, ui/listbox.c, ui/radio.c, ui/scroll.c, ui/userbox.c: Make the editor draw the same for the non-ogl build as the ogl build, since I just made it draw the grey background over everything in the last commit. If you want to see what it's *supposed* to look like, go to yesterday's commit :P

20120330
--------
2d/font.c: Make 2d/font.c more similar between d1x-rebirth and d2x-rebirth
arch/include/event.h: Changed declaration of event_get_idle_second() from int32_t to fix since Windows does not know it without pstypes.h. Included maths.h for this but should now work flawlessly on all platforms

20120329
--------
main/multi.c, main/multi.h, main/net_udp.c, main/net_udp.h: Immediately relay pdata packets from clients to others which should reduce artificial delay; allow sending of pdata packet when firing if enough time has passed since last update; only answer full game info requests 2 times per second and lite info 8 times per second

main/gamecntl.c: Fixed unhandled case in key reading when escort hotkeys are disabled
main/net_udp.c: Since the kicked message is shown after player is technically removed from the game we do not know hosts name anymore. Message changed accordingly
main/multi.c, main/multi.h, main/newdemo.c, main/player.h: Allow a total of 32 different player ship textures and stored N_PLAYER_SHIP_TEXTURES in player.h
main/config.c: Dynamically allocate line to read from descent.cfg and ensure a safe length
main/weapon.c: Release Fusion charge when changing to another weapon similar to D1X-Rebirth

20120324
--------
arch/ogl/gr.c, arch/sdl/gr.c, ui/menubar.c: Draw the editor menubar properly - by drawing in response to EVENT_WINDOW_DRAW and initialising the screen canvas properly. The latter fixes a lot of other editor drawing issues as well

main/cntrlcen.c, main/newdemo.c, main/switch.c, main/wall.c, main/wall.h: Reworked wall_toggle() to work with index for segnum instead of a pointer, hopefully making the consistency check less error prone

20110923
--------
main/state.c: When restoring Coop players and make turn them into ghosts perform a check if this player is actually a valid player so we do not just blindly use any object number from a possibly uninitialized player structure

20110921
--------
main/net_udp.c: Streamlined joining, rejoining, disconnecting players and timeouts, getting rid of unwanted rejoin messages and let host remove a player for good without rejoining it via pdata packet to really get rid of lossy or unwanted players; Care for rollover of pkt_num of stored mdata packets
main/game.c: Fixed overuse of multi_send_sound_function when handling afterburner in case player is dead or escaped
main/net_udp.c: Added wrapper functions dxx_sendto and dxx_recvfrom to collect simple statistics about amount and size of packets sent/received per second; Actually fixed packet scheduling in main UDP frame - was sending more than intended - stupid me

20110919
--------
main/multi.h, main/net_udp.c: Reworked Packet Loss Prevention: If an important packet could not be recovered until it timed out, dump player who failed sending/receiving it; Noloss queue can proces spackets until a certain traffic has been reached; In main UDP frame schedule different types of packets depending on PPS to decrease traffic produced in one frame, hopefully preventing too much loss in high-traffic situations; Small code cleanups; Added new dump signal for loss of important packet; When dumping player also disconnect that one in case the dumped player does not accept the signal

main/songs.c: Correctly proceed to new Redbook track if songnum != Song_playing (hopefully - to confirm); Using songs_stop_all() in songs_uninit() to clear redundancy; added some notes to functions to shine a bit light on the mess of some functions; Also if there's no escape song, continue level music
arch/sdl/rbaudio.c, main/inferno.c: Fixing Redbook hooks: Initialize last_check_time in RBACheckFinishedHook(); Execute RBACheckFinishedHook() during EVENT_WINDOW_DRAW in standard_handler() as EVENT_IDLE rarely happens if you have a shivering Joystick connected for example
arch/carbon/conf.h, SConstruct: Changed version to 0.57.1; Updated release notes

20110715
--------
main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c: When updating netgame hoard game flag used for compability reasons must be removed as it can be set - otherwise screwing up game mode display in netlist menu
arch/sdl/digi.c, main/digi.h, main/songs.c, misc/hmp.c: Bail out of hmp_reset() if midiOutOpen fails and return error with -debug set; execute hmp_reset() before first song plays; renamed digi_win32_stop_current_song() to digi_win32_stop_midi_song() to keep naming convention; Fixed some compiler warnings
main/net_udp.c, main/net_udp.h: Fixed typo in Packets per sec. in GAME_RULES screen; Reduced max amount of games shown on netlist to 900 to reduce RAM usage... as if we'd ever reach this
main/automap.c: properly check and fix viewMatrix in free flight auotmap

20110714
--------
main/collide.c: When colliding with robot not controlled by us in Multi-Robot game do not apply force or damage - wait until the robot is under our control - preventing juggeling robots back and forth between players and creating massive damage
main/multi.c: Due to descent2.ham reloading, hoard.ham must realod properly as well; cover multi_send_sound_function by plp preventing sound loops get lost/screwed in action

20110713
--------
arch/sdl/event.c, arch/sdl/key.c, main/kconfig.c, main/menu.c: Stability fixes: avoid somfusions with same named variables in one function; Properly sort out players from player list that use too long filenames; Removed call for gr_set_fontcolor in kconfig where no canvas is set, causing crashes when trying to reassign a button, key or axis

20110712
--------
main/wall.c: Readded automatic wall-flag setting for opened doors as PLP cannot protect us from negative side-effects due to how gullible multi_do_door_open() works
main/multibot.c: Fixed uninitialized bytes in multi_do_create_robot_powerups() and two set but unused variables

20110710
--------
main/gameseg.c: Added complex error output if illegal segnum passed to get_seg_masks(); Fixed warning about set but unused variables

20110709
--------
main/gamerend.c, main/gauges.h: In Multiplayer games show player names in big guided window as well
main/multibot.c: Just like for players do not protect robot firing or positional data (via PLP) to prevent jumpy movement with delayed packets
main/lighting.c: Added new dynamic light calculation which works with find_connected_distance() preventing vertecies to be lit up without connection to light source but still maintaining illumination. Still deactivated as it needs more optimization - planned for 0.58. Removed old alternative dynamic lighting which was suppoed to work via fvi but way slower than the new one

20110708
--------
main/net_udp.c: Slight improvement for Packet Loss Prevention: Be able to send to 35 packets per call of net_udp_noloss_process_queue() and also let counter only increase if a packet was actually sent, making sure the queue is not stuck on the first 5 packets in the list
arch/sdl/digi.c: Make sure hmp_reset() is only executed if a song was playing

20110704
--------
main/game.c, main/gamerend.c: Only call show_netplayerinfo() if GM_MULTI is set and reset netplayerinfo_on in game_setup()
misc/physfsx.c: Fixed typo

20110702
--------
main/ai.c: When initializing ai object correctly initialize Ai_local_info to prevent glitches like random submodel angles
main/menu.c: Reset idle timer in main menu correctly even after playing the intro movie; Also got rid of a goto as it's generally bad and not needed since random demo selection picks a correct demo anyways

20110701
--------
d2x.ini, main/inferno.c, main/net_udp.h, misc/args.c: Made formatting for help text more consistent and prettier; Somewhat changed the code for help text so we can use variables in the help text. For example: If we change MAXIMUM_FPS, it will automatically be displayed in the help text without manual editing needed

20110630

20110628
--------
main/state.c: Fixed possible memory corruption when saving Current_mission_filename which is not necessarily a 9 byte long allocated string; Bit safer string handling with snprintf; Fixed set but unused variables like a boss
main/net_ipx.c: Correctly disable/initialize Multiplayer features not supported by IPX games for compability; Removed show_games_rules as there isn't much useful to show there; Some more code simplicity; Fixed sending of allowed items; Fixed player selection screen

20110624
--------
main/net_udp.c: Fixed object sync for latecoming clients which was broken due to a very, very, VERY stupid mistake...

20110623
--------
main/hud.c: PlayerCfg.MultiMessages was supposed to only show messages of class HM_MULTI but turned out to only block HM_REDUNDANT, too. Fixed this copy/paste error of mine
main/laser.c: For Hotshot and above made homing missiles turn to player a bit less agressive which is hardly noticable but slightly increases the chance to shake off a projective even if dodged without perfect timing. This makes possible to survive in case a player/bot shoots several homing projectiles in spread fashion

20110621
--------
misc/args.c: When GameArg.CtlNoStickyKeys was introduced I forgot to add an actual check if -nostickykeys was supplied - fixed now

20110620
--------
main/lighting.c: in compute_light_emission() handle RT_NONE for delayed explosion fireballs

20110617
--------
main/physics.c: By using fixed distance bumping for fix_illegal_wall_intersection making the whole process much more reliable on sharp edges

20110609
--------
main/render.c: Saturate colored dynamic light just like normal one - makes the hwole thing a bit less colorful but makes for better balanced color mixing (theoretically) and does not reduce static light

20110607
--------
main/switch.c: Correctly disable secret levels for Shareware
main/render.c: Definition of dynlight_time should have been static to archive timed light calculations

20110606
--------
main/menu.c, main/playsave.c: For all filename strings use PATH_MAX as size, make sure they are inited correctly and only fill them with snprintf instead of sprintf

20110604
--------
main/lighting.c: Since set_dynamic_light() is not necessarily processed each frame, added own counter for delayed precession of vertex-clight calculation; Added possibility to page in a bitmap in case an object which has never been rendered before is supposed to cast light visible by the player 
main/digiobj.c, main/piggy.c: Don't force AltSounds on PC-Shareware content but still must bail out on missing sounds using a small hack. Still gives a better sound palette than AltSounds
main/titles.c: Play SONG_BRIEFING and SONG_ENDGAME on all non-builtin missions if available
main/endlevel.c: Correctly handle PC Shareware for start_endlevel_movie() again without the defines but via is_SHAREWARE
main/digiobj.c: Just generally ignore missing sounds in digi_xlat_sound just like D1X-Rebirth - not limit to Shareware
main/multi.c: for flexibility in terms of modding, allow player ship textures in Multiplayer be <= N_PLAYER_SHIP_TEXTURES and not hit Assert but pull out Eroor if there are more

20110601

2d/font.c, 2d/palette.c, 2d/pcx.c, arch/linux/hmiplay.c, arch/ogl/gr.c, arch/sdl/digi_mixer_music.c, arch/sdl/jukebox.c, editor/group.c, editor/kmine.c, editor/med.c, editor/mine.c, iff/iff.c, include/interp.h, include/physfsx.h, main/ai.c, main/automap.c, main/bm.c, main/bm.h, main/bmread.c, main/cntrlcen.c, main/cntrlcen.h, main/credits.c, main/digiobj.c, main/effects.c, main/effects.h, main/endlevel.c, main/fireball.c, main/fireball.h, main/fuelcen.c, main/fuelcen.h, main/game.c, main/game.h, main/gamefont.c, main/gamemine.c, main/gamemine.h, main/gamesave.c, main/gameseq.c, main/inferno.c, main/menu.c, main/menu.h, main/mission.c, main/movie.c, main/multi.c, main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c, main/newdemo.c, main/newmenu.c, main/piggy.c, main/piggy.h, main/player.c, main/player.h, main/playsave.c, main/polyobj.c, main/polyobj.h, main/powerup.c, main/powerup.h, main/robot.c, main/robot.h, main/segment.c, main/segment.h, main/songs.c, main/state.c, main/switch.c, main/switch.h, main/text.c, main/titles.c, main/vclip.c, main/vclip.h, main/wall.c, main/wall.h, main/weapon.c, main/weapon.h, misc/hmp.c, misc/ignorecase.c, misc/physfsx.c, misc/strio.c, ui/keypad.c, ui/menubar.c: Got rid of cfile code: Renamed cfile-functions to use PHYSFSX-naming convention, Replaced cfile-macros with proper PHYSFS(X) calls; Introduced PHYSFSX_exists() which can check case-sensitive or case-insensitive to give more flexibility with game content
main/endlevel.c: When reaching EL_FLYTHROUGH in do_endlevel_frame() do not check for start_endlevel_movie() anymore but rather it's result so this subfunction does not get called again which does not only save us from executing pointless code and code which screws up flythrough sequence
main/game.c: Executing timer_update() at the beginning of calc_frame_time in case event_process() taking a significant amount of time to reach the game window and therefor could make FrameTime be inaccurate
main/lighting.c: Added proper colored lighting handling for RT_POWERUP which I not noticed was wrong before ... darn dim glowing powerups

20110530
--------
arch/include/digi_audio.h, arch/include/digi_mixer.h, arch/sdl/digi.c, arch/sdl/digi_mixer.c, main/digi.h, main/digiobj.c: Added own channel management to SDL_mixer sound interface since the builtin channel management of this lib cannot handle our needs; Little code cleanup

20110528
--------
main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c: Made netgame setup menu more flexible towards (constant or temporary) changes in available game modes

20110526
--------
arch/sdl/event.c: In event_process() if a window closes while being drawn and there isn't a previous window we can get the next from just finish processing for this frame
main/gamerend.c: in game_render_frame_mono() call show_netplayerinfo() last so window views do not overlap

20110525
--------
main/multi.c, main/multi.h, main/net_ipx.h, main/net_udp.c: Added multi_send_data_direct to send multibuf to a specific player (i.e. Host<->Client, not Client<->Client); Overhauled kill sending/receiving and computation to rely in host information about game_mode-related variables (team_vector, Bounty_target) which are vital for consistent kill computation; Added function to send/update game_mode-related variables and solve /move command with this as well instead of workaround via updating lite_info

20110522
--------
editor/med.c, main/game.c, main/gameseg.c, main/gameseq.c, main/menu.c: Like in BigEndian builds do netmisc_calc_checksum() only with expected items of segment/side struct to prevent different checksums in case these structs change; Fixed several issues when building with editor; Fixed compiler warning regarding set but unused variable
main/net_udp.c: When restoring Coop setting from netgame profile don't forget to fix max players variable

20110520
--------
INSTALL.txt, RELEASE-NOTES.txt: Updated docs and fixed some typos
main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c: Rearranged code to check for netgame-closed flag and refuse-players flag so they are updated correctly if another part of the code changes the menu item without activating it
main/automap.c, main/menu.c, main/playsave.c, main/playsave.h: Made Automap Free Flight controls an optional feature which can be set in MISC OPTIONS
main/net_udp.c: Let players launch 1-player team-based games in RELEASE build as well
main/net_udp.c: Making D1X- and D2X-Rebirth more similar in behavior of which player limit is needed to start team-based game in both RELEASE and DEBUG builds

20110519
--------
main/fvi.c, main/fvi.h, main/physics.c: Improvement for fix_illegal_wall_interesection(): Move away from wall in right angle - not towards center. This improves the bumping in many situations and prevents ship getting stuck in small segments. Simplified and optimized code as well and removed check for degenerated Segments as not needed with this approach; Fixed some compiler warnings regarding set but unused variables
main/multi.c: Reset new_Bounty_target after using it  and let host add a number on how often Bounty is reassigned. Both additions should help keeping target correct no matter how if multiple packets of the same type are disordered, delayed or both
main/physics.c: for fix_illegal_wall_intersection() try using the distance we moved to move out from the wall. Just in case it's a sane value, i.e. > 0 and <= obj->size/2
arch/ogl/gr.c, main/game.c: Removed key_flush() call from save_screen_shot() - not needed anymore due to new input reading and only screws up ingame controls

20110516
--------
main/menu.c: for debug build ignore player Highest_level_index when starting a mission, making *Load Level* entry in main menu obsolete; Fixed two compiler warnings regarding set but unused variables

20110515
--------
main/multi.c: Solved possible issue when setting new Bounty_target via host messing up scores or new target itself - only set if player decided why to unset Bounty_target, keeping code flow and game logic in order; Fixed two compiler warnings regarding set but unused variables
RELEASE-NOTES.txt: Added more info: M3U-support, GCC 4.6 warnings, more tracker infos

20110513
--------
main/multi.c: Send player position also when multi_send_player_explode() is called so powerups drop at the right spot in case the respawn packet arrives first

20110507
--------
arch/carbon/conf.h: Enabled Tracker support for Mac OS
RELEASE-NOTES.txt, README.txt, SConstruct, arch/carbon/conf.h: Changed version from 0.56 to 0.57; Added first draft for RELEASE-NOTES.txt; updated docs
main/endlevel.c: Taken out Render_depth reduction of Endlevel sequence in Software rendering build; Fixed two compiler warnings regarding set but unused variables
main/automap.c: Don't call automap_process_input() if autmap_key_command() returns 1 preventing input mess

20110505
--------
main/gauges.c, main/multi.h, main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c, main/net_udp.h, main/playsave.c: Host can now decide (again) if players are allowed to display enemy names on HUD
d2x-rebirth.desktop, debian/changelog, debian/control, debian/copyright, debian/rules: Update for Debian packaging stuff
main/lighting.c: Correctly handle light computation of objects with render_type RT_LASER

20110504
--------
editor/segment.c, main/fvi.c, main/gameseg.c, main/physics.c, main/segment.h: Since current approach to improve wall collisions prevented the player to enter segments which basically are too small for the player ship, added simple bumping function via object_intersects_wall(); Also when validating segments check for segment degeneration outside the editor build, too and set flag in segment structure for all different purposes but right now helps us to disable bumping when encountering degenerated segments and not break such levels
main/endlevel.c: Make sure the big explosion at the end of the escape sequence also uses blending if transparency effects are activated
main/multi.c: Fix crash in multi_maybe_disable_friendly_fire() when killer == NULL; Do not let player join game when gamemode is HOARD or TEAM HOARD and hoard.ham is not available
2d/font.c: mipmapping was always on for fonts due to changed filtering code in ogl.c
main/physics.c: To compensate fewer FVI runs in lower FPS and wall penetration caused by strong forces allowed fix_illegal_wall_intersection() to move an object out of the wall half it's size improving the collisions once more
main/segment.h, main/state.c: Due to increased size of MAX_SEGMENTS old savegames became incompatible. To compensate added MAX_SEGMENTS_ORIGINAL with the original segment amount and read certain savegame info with this info when dealing with standard-sized levels and use Highest_segment_index when dealing with larger levels which are incompatible with older versions of the game anyways. Makes savegame site more efficient and still maintain backwards compability
main/render.c: When doing sorted rendering, also take cloaking walls into account to properly draw objects behind it while cloaking process

20110422
--------
2d/rle.c, SConstruct, main/segment.h, main/texmerge.c: Expanded possibilities for level authors: RLE- and Texture-cache accepts textures bigger than 64x64, only limit being Texture width must be equal height; Increased maximum amount of Segments from 900 to 9000 - not dynamically allocating them, yet
arch/sdl/mouse.c, main/kconfig.c, main/menu.c, main/playsave.c, main/playsave.h: When reading ingame controls only flush mouse delta timer-based since reading is event-based already, allowing high precision no matter the game speed; Removed Mouse smoothing/filtering as it's now unnecessary due to event-based motion handling
2d/rle.c, main/texmerge.c: Fixes for RLE- and Texture-cache modifcations: Before freeing now must check if bitmap is already allocated
main/menu.c, main/net_udp.c, main/playsave.c, main/playsave.h: Remember previously set up netgame variables in pilot-related file with extension ngp - due to feature consistency for UDP only

20110421
--------
main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c: When leaving game and still sending extras, don't forget to update the timer so we won't get stuck in an infinite loop
arch/sdl/key.c: Added SDLK_WORLD_** symbols to keyboard array to enable layout specific keys and make the game more flexible

20110420
--------
main/multi.c, main/state.c: Resolved termination issue when reading and comparing callsigns fro Coop savestates; Added scores sending after Coop savestate loading as unrestored players will send them when loading new level
main/gameseq.c, main/misison.c: Moved reloading of main descent2.ham (in case mission brings it's own version) from LoadLevel() to load_mission() so it does not screw missions with ther custom ham-file (like vertigo)

20110418
--------
arch/sdl/digi_mixer_music.c, arch/sdl/jukebox.c, main/config.c, main/menu.c, main/songs.c, main/songs.h, main/titles.c: Fix broken m3u playlist support (in jukebox_play() path resolving); point to default descent.m3u playlist for Mac OS X (will be included in bundle); better error reporting in mix_play_file(); only make relative Jukebox path in the menu absolute after browsing it - relative paths are more flexible; allow select_file_recursive() to figure out PhysicsFS relative paths passed to it; stop the music if Jukebox is chosen and unavailable (used to just keep playing the last song)

20110416
--------
main/gamecntl.c, main/gauges.c: Due to controls rewrite was not possible anymore to send multiplayer messages while being dead - added specific exception to allow this; Rewrote show_HUD_names to only show names, indicators or typing string for enemy players when they are not cloaked; Small fix for position of Afterburner gauge in CM_FULL_SCREEN
misc/hmp.c: Check for hmp before pausing/resuming it
main/laser.c: Initialize variables in create_omega_blobs() and give omega_cleanup() a return value to see if we should continue rendering to fix potential crashes

20110414
--------
main/kmatrix.c: Fixing km struct being used after it's being freed by closing the window in EVENT_WINDOW_DRAW
main/wall.c: Took out hack to force close doors as not needed anymore and does not take into account linked walls

20110413
--------
main/net_udp.c, main/net_udp.h: Improved security for UDP protocol: Add checks for correct packet size and - if possible - valid sender address (valid player) and making sure Clients only accept packets meant for Clients and Hosts only accept packets meant for Hosts
main/fvi.c, main/physics.c: Bit more safeguarding in find_plane_line_intersection() and as a result less agressive but more beautiful back-bumping on illegal wall interesections; Scaling of movement from PhysTime to FrameTime now done with vector math functions
main/credits.c: Fixing unfreed buffer when credits_show() was called but there was nothing to show me
main/lighting.c: Reset obj_color for colored object lights when object does not return any usable color so the object will cast white light at least

20110412
--------
main/game.c, main/gauges.c, main/multi.h, main/net_ipx.c, main/net_ipx.h, main/net_udp.c, main/net_udp.h: Little fix for typing-indicator in multiplayer - was showing comma even if no player name was displayed; Removed team_vector from UDP lite_info structure - it's not needed; Removed ShowAllNames from Netgame structure as I see no reason why names display should be host-controlled; Increased UDP_NETGAMES_PAGES to actually show 3000 possible games
main/laser.c: Stupid me forgot to let Omega use it's charge again after debugging it - fixed...
include/gr.h, main/bm.c, main/bm.h, main/gamesave.c, main/lighting.c, main/multi.c, main/object.c, main/object.h, main/piggy.c, main/render.c, main/state.c: Execute set_dynamic_light 60 times per second max since more would just be a waste of CPU time; When executing set_dynamic_light, process ALL lights; Instead of storing light color in objects, do it on-thy-fly but store bitmap-based color in grs_bitmap - vastly speeds up colored dynamic lights; Improved saturation for vertex lighting to make light color a bit more subtile
main/playsave.c: kconfig weapon cycling fields changed after 0.56 release will automatically fix if version number changes on next release

20110411
--------
main/game.c, main/gamecntl.c, main/gamerend.c, main/gauges.c, main/multi.c, main/multi.h: Improved syntax for Multi messages/commands: Commands starting with '/' and those accepting arguments as well as Player/Team messages require space after ':' ; Added indicator on HUD to show if a player is typing a message to prevent accidential kills
main/collide.c, main/hud.c, main/hudmsg.h, main/powerup.c, main/weapon.c: Introduced HUD message class HM_MAYDUPL for messages that may appear once per frame but the player might not able to supress via option

20110410
--------
main/collide.c, main/laser.c, main/laser.h, main/object.c, main/object.h, main/vclip.c: Reworked Omega cannon: Instead of firing every frame, fire in 33.33ms intervals instead which will improve performance, decrease network traffic and make damage in Multiplayer not a totally random factor; To compensate inaccuracy due high velocity of leading omega blob, check for it's distance from parent and delete if distance > MAX
main/gamerend.c, main/gauges.c, main/titles.c: Fixed text-related annoyances: Fixed positions of strings TXT_CLOAKED and TXT_CRUISE in CM_FULL_SCREEN; Fixed scaling of tab_stop in briefings (again)
INSTALL.txt: Tell people about The Unarchiver for installing from the Mac game CD (thanks, Jonathan!)
arch/ogl/gr.c: Smash texture list when switching between window mode and fullscreen prevent invalid textures; Made code to capture Screenshots more similar between OpenGL and OpenGL ES
3d/interp.c, main/automap.c: Allow completely free movement in the automap. It will rotate relative to the viewer. Also fix an unused variable warning.

20110408
--------
main/net_udp.c: Allow multi_send_fire when necessary and not crop to PPS so fix weapons with high firing rate

20110407
--------
3d/draw.c, 3d/interp.c, 3d/rod.c, arch/ogl/ogl.c, include/3d.h, include/interp.h, include/ogl_init.h, main/endlevel.c, main/gamesave.c, main/lighting.c, main/lighting.h, main/menu.c, main/morph.c, main/multi.c, main/object.c, main/object.h, main/playsave.c, main/playsave.h, main/polyobj.c, main/polyobj.h, main/render.c, main/state.c, main/terrain.c: Made lighting code work with actual RGB values and added feature to let certain objects emit colored dynamic light as well as let mine flash red when control center destroyed (OpenGL-only at the moment)
main/physics.c: When sliding along a wall keep wall_part sane to ensure good velocity for slide

20110405
--------
SConstruct, arch/win32/ipx.c, d2x.ini, include/args.h, main/inferno.c, main/menu.c, main/multi.h, main/net_ipx.h, main/net_udp.c, main/net_udp.h, misc/args.c: Client-side implementation for Tracker support by Matt "1360" Vandermeulen including improvements in udp_dns_filladdr and IPv4/IPv6 compability; Very little adjustments by me, too including IPv6 support for Windows (untested); Actual tracker code will follow later as seperate branch when it's done

20110329
--------
main/cntrlcen.c, main/cntrlcen.h, main/state.c: Dead_controlcen_object_num should be set when a new level starts in debug build, too; Setting Total_countdown_time when loading a savestate so SEF-DESTRUCT SEQUENCE ACTIVATED sample will not play soon as timer reaches 0

20110328
--------
main/endlevel.c, main/newdemo.c: Properly record the event of reset_rear_view() while switching levels to make it work right when rewinding as well; Properly record Countdown seconds for each newdemo frame instead of second change to get display showing up right while playback and still preserving backwards compability; Suspend Game_wind when playing endlevel movie while demo playback
arch/ogl/gr.c: Fixes for OpenGL ES implementation

20110327
--------
main/physics.c: Another rework for anti-stuck-bumping: Execute after calculation of velocity and add fvi check to make sure we deal with an actual wall collision
main/gamesave.c: Added hack to fix illegal segment (104) in D2 Level 12 which should be fixed in the level itself but impossible due to copyright of original game content...

20110314
--------
main/fvi.c, main/physics.c: Again reworked new bump hack to only apply when fate == HIT_WALL (to not break level SKYBOX) and made bumping by distance  between object position and wall hit point; Removed/handled some safety checks in find_plane_line_intersection() to make sliding along joining edges smoother again while bad values *should* be handled in pyhsics.c and not make object warp-crashing tru the whole level or stuck in walls (fvi code should still be rewritten tho)

20110310
--------
main/kconfig.c: Due to lazy copy&paste sliding up/down speed was divided by 2 - fixed

20110306
--------
main/songs.c: Be safer not interrupting other ports of descent or the original MS-DOS game when it comes to reading song files: Try reading from MISSION_NAME.sngdxx to have a way reading a song file for a specific mission outside the mission's HOG, next try reading from descent.sngdxx which shall serve as an alternative song file specifically for DXX and then try descent.sng. This should give authors enough possibilities to add OSTs for all different versions of the game without the need to publish different versions of their missions

20110224
--------
2d/canvas.c: Fix for last revision: Correctly initialize cv_fade_level and cv_blend_func when creating initializing a canvas
main/multi.c, main/piggy.c: Using gr_init_bitmap for hoard data initialization; Correctly free hoard data before the program closes; When reloading the main HAM files, made sure it does not try to reload main game sounds from shareware/demo HAM

20110223
--------
2d/2dsline.c, 2d/canvas.c, arch/ogl/gr.c, arch/ogl/ogl.c, arch/sdl/gr.c, include/3d.h, include/gr.h, include/ogl_init.h, main/ai.c, main/ai.h, main/console.c, main/effects.h, main/gamerend.c, main/gauges.c, main/hud.c, main/menu.c, main/multibot.c, main/newmenu.c, main/object.c, main/playsave.c, main/playsave.h, main/render.c, texmap/tmapflat.c: Added cv_fade_level to canvas structure to replace Gr_scanline_darkening_level; Added cv_blend_func to canvas structure to set blending; Introduced gr_settransblend to set cv_fade_level and cv_blend_func; Added function to set normal blending, additive alpha blending and additive color blending; Moved Special transparency effects from g3_draw_bitmap to render_object to set individual transparency and/or blending for each object outside of OpenGL-specific code; Added special blending for fuelcenter and force field effects as well; Removed unused LASER_HACK code; Renamed OglAlphaEffects variable of PalyerCfg to AlphaEffects as I plan to implement this kind of effects for Software renderer, too

20110221
--------
misc/strutil.c: Fix a critical bug in string_array_add - when d_reallocing the buffer containing the string data, update all the pointers in '*list' as well as next_str, preventing ugly crashes

20110219
--------
main/gameseq.c: Added another call for read_hamfile right after a level loads in case a third party mission brings it's own version of the main game HAM file

20110218
--------
arch/ogl/ogl.c, include/ogl_init.h, main/endlevel.c, main/object.c: Draw laser effects with special blending instead of disabled DepthMask; Added special blending for transparency effects as well to let them kick more ass; Corrections while rendering outside part of endlevel sequence with disabled depth testing and dynamically changing Render_depth to make the mine exit visible again while not rendering the exit tunnel tru the planet terrain
arch/ogl/ogl.c: Set zNear for gluPerspective to 0.1 to prevent ugly clipping while passing illusory walls; Set zFar to 5000.0 to prevent disappearing automap in large distance - all still sane enough for Intel chips so my eeePC is safe nyahahaha

20110217
--------
main/wall.c: When recording cloaking or unclocking wall to demo, make sure the very first frame is recorded, too so wall will correctly transform back when rewinding the demo

20110215
--------
main/gamecntl.c: Fixed PRShot feature which was accidentially broken while implementation of OpenGL ES support

20110214
--------
SConstruct, d2x.ini, include/args.h, main/ai.c, main/ai.h, main/ai2.c, main/automap.c, main/cntrlcen.c, main/collide.c, main/config.c, main/config.h, main/escort.c, main/escort.h, main/fvi.c, main/game.c, main/game.h, main/gamecntl.c, main/gamerend.c, main/gameseq.c, main/gameseq.h, main/gauges.c, main/inferno.c, main/kconfig.c, main/laser.c, main/menu.c, main/multi.c, main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c, main/physics.c, main/player.h, main/render.c, main/state.c, misc/args.c: Moved all these unsorted global cheat variables to a handy structure; Simplified reading of the cheats without trying to make it complicated so no one finds them (everyone can get the source); Removed one or two cheats which carry more garbage than they are worth; Added replacement for the bittersweet cheat; Made FPS Counter an option of Graphics menu
main/credits.c, main/titles.c: For credits and briefings moved all code happened in EVENT_IDLE to EVENT_WINDOW_DRAW since a jitterish Joystick could slow down text rendering

20110212
--------
arch/inlcude/window.h, arch/sdl/event.c, arch/sdl/window.c, main/game.c: New approach to handle a bunch of closing windows - removed window_do_close() again, reworked game_leave_menus by checking window_get_front() and closing this window until it's Game_wind, while event_process checking if window still exists after drawing and if not, take next window from previous which should be updated by then

20110211
--------
main/gamecntl.c, main/kconfig.c, main/newmenu.c: Controls.select_weapon_count needs to be incremented differently to get non-0 when we want to select the laser type weapon; Readded jumping from first to last item in newmenu and vice versa

20110210
--------
main/automap.c, main/gauges.c, main/gauges.h, main/kconfig.c, main/newmenu.c, main/newmenu.h: Fixed broken FlightSim indicator on Automap; Fixed Assert for using mouse buttons in kconfig (which can react to UP and DOWN states); Added scrolling support for menus flagged tiny_mode and all_text
arch/ogl/gr.c, arch/sdl/gr.c, d2x.ini, include/args.h, main/inferno.c, misc/args.c: Simplified ogl version of gr.c in terms of SDL video flags and fullscreen toggle; Added command-line/INI option to remove borders from windowed program
main/multi.c: Fixed compiler warning related to generation of game_id for Coop Savegames
arch/ogl/ogl.c, main/gamerend.c, main/gauges.c, main/gauges.h: Added secondary weapon indicators to new reticle types; Fixed disks being drawn as circles - whoops

20110209
--------
main/ai.c, main/game.c, main/gamecntl.c, main/gameseq.c, main/menu.c, main/multi.c, main/multi.h, main/state.c, main/state.h: Reintroduced Savegames for Coop games using the original Descent2 implementation but correctly handling player slots in their pre-loading state preventing accidential player shifting which never really worked in the original game and we do not want with UDP anyways - was all tested but still might need a fix or two; Added some missing initializations for saving players and AI stuff; Completely ripped out remnants of saving between levels code
main/movie.c: Fixed little memory issue while playing movies introduced by overhaul of window closing
arch/ogl/ogl.c: Fixed memory leak produced by drawing circles and disks

20110206
--------
arch/include/key.h, main/automap.c: Increased key repeat values to react a little more like the MS-DOS version of the game but a little slower so I can still stop at the correct item; In automap reorganized control_info swapping as well as wiggle state handling to properly work in connection with the new input handling and Multiplayer where game is not paused

20110203
--------
main/automap.c, main/gamecntl.c: Little fixes for recent kconfig/event overhaul: Automap inputs read by kconfig should be processed by input rather than idle and automap frame calculations should be done while drawing; Fixed drop_bomb_count which could roll over to 255 dropping bombs without end
main/gauges: Corrected values for gr_ubox while drawing a window_view to not mess up at some widescreen resolutions
arch/include/window.h, arch/sdl/event.c, arch/sdl/window.c: Included new window structure flag w_closing_state and let window_close() set this flag - after drawing all windows, check them again and call window_do_close() which then actually closes the window(s) marked to.  Solving all sorts of problems when windows close while being drawn (network error messageboxes, game_leave_menus(), etc.)

--------
arch/include/event.h, arch/include/joy.h, arch/include/key.h, arch/include/mouse.h, arch/sdl/event.c, arch/sdl/joy.c, arch/sdl/key.c, arch/sdl/mouse.c, main/automap.c, main/endlevel.c, main/game.c, main/gamecntl.c, main/inferno.c, main/kconfig.c, main/kconfig.h, main/movie.c, main/multi.c, main/newmenu.c, main/slew.c: Added event types for all input actions; Rewrote kconfig code to work with events; static defined inputs will not trigger kconfig-mapped inputs anymore; Simplified keyboard, mouse and joystick code a lot due to event-based handling; Added function to toggle SDL key repeats on and off; Put timer_update() to event_process; Removed return when event_poll() is idle to get cursor hiding to work again; Added a small delay between cursoe hiding and re-enabling to cursor will not accidentially enable by SDL event centering cursor while hiding
arch/ogl/ogl.c: After rendering Reboot reticle, reset glLineWidth to default value again
main/fireball.c, main/gameseq.c, main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c: Little more smoothness for Multiplayer: Before dropping Powerups in random segment, make sure it's accessible by the player who drops it; Got rid of goto in InitPlayerPositions() and made code more D2-ish; Allow host to send 50 object/extra packets per second which does not overload network stack, yet but speeds up joining

20110126
--------
arc/sdl/event.c: In event_process() check for wind->next before sending EVENT_WINDOW_DRAW in case drawing will free wind

20110124
--------
main/physics.c: Revamped what previously was the BUMP_HACK by checking if an object is actually intersecting a segment and move it out towards segment center just after the initial object movement composed by fvi and before velocity is made - should make inaccurate wall collisions a bit smoother and prevent objects from goind inside or through walls, too
main/physics.c: Added some new conditions to the bumping code: Only bump objects which can slide (alive robots and players) and added a count making sure this function can never get stuck in an infinite loop
main/collide.c, main/fireball.c: Some improvements and cleanups for Persistent Debris: Let them bounce, added drag and let them explode on hazardous walls

20110123
--------
main/ai2.c: Taking out one Int3 in init_boss_segments() stopping the program if there is more than one boss in level - taking out because it's not fatal or unsafe to do that; Also removed one conditional size_check which was meant for one mprintf we removed long ago
main/physics.c: Increasing the collision count for objects so there can be 8 for all objects; also do not increase count when colliding with a powerup as it should not change our movement
main/playsave.c: For new player, set ReticleSize to 0 which is the smallest size

20110122
--------
main/console.c, main/game.c, main/gamerend.c, main/gauges.c: Added timer_update() to stop/start/reset_time() functions so resumed last_timer_value will be precise; Added new FPS counter which actually does count the frames rendered per second and is less irritating; Added timer_dleay2 call to console to not stress CPU too much; Imporoved placement for show_time(), multi messages, marker messages and orb counts
main/multi.c: Fixed small issue parsing killreactor command in Multiplayer
include/byteswap.h: Added swapping for 64Bit sized integers in case we want to store/read them some day (i.e. new Savegame version storing object instead of object_rw)
main/gamerend.c: in show_framerate do not use gr_get_string_size at all but rather use hardcoded coordinates - less CPU-intense
main/fvi.c: Removed fvi_a.h and added the asm code from it as comment to fvi.c in case we need it again some day

20110121
--------
main/render.c: Protection for negative array index in find_seg_side was accidentially checking for vv1 != -1 - fixed that

20110120
--------
arch/sdl/jukebox.c, main/digi.h, main/menu.c, main/songs.c: Added a simple random function for the Jukebox; Removed one small printf I once added for debugging

20110119
--------
main/game.h, main/gamerend.c, main/gauges.c, main/multi.c, main/multi.h, main/net_udp.c: Introducing new BOUNTY Multiplayer game mode by Matt "1360" Vandermeulen <matt1360@gmail.com>
main/gauges.c, main/multi.c: Fix for showing bounty target in kill list - was not actually checking if player_num == Bounty_target; When Bounty_target player leaves game host must select a new target so the game can proceed
main/gamerend.c, main/multi.c, main/multi.h, main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c, main/text.h: On NETGAMES list Bounty mode was not shown since MODE_NAMES define was not adjusted - so in the end introduced GMNames and GMNamesShrt Arrays in multi.c for globally displaying full or short Multiplayer game mode names
2d/bitmap.c, 2d/bitmap.h, 2d/canvas.c, 2d/font.c, 2d/scale.c, 2d/scalec.c, 2d/tmerge.c, SConstruct, arch/linux/alsadigi.c, arch/sdl/digi_audio.c, arch/sdl/digi_mixer.c, include/error.h, include/maths.h, main/fvi_a.h, main/inferno.c, maths/fixc.c, maths/vecmat.c, texmap/scanline.c: Retired most of the Assembler code except the generic i386 scanline renderer; Removed all leftovers of Direct3D implementation; On the way make a some code more similar between D1X-Rebirth and D2X-Rebirth

20110118
--------
main/net_udp.c: Fixed small bug in net_udp_list_join_poll() which was introduced when I reorganized the events for making console render global
main/gamecntl.c, main/gameseq.c: Allowing loading a savestate while being in death sequence and resetting Dead_player_camera correctly in init_player_stats_level() so forther death sequences won't screw up
main/net_udp.c: In net_udp_send_objects() player_num byte was not considered for mode 1 resulting on incorrect object count for this mode
main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c: Instead of calling object/extras sending every frame, use a delay of 100ms between packet send to not overload the network stack

20110117
--------
arch/sdl/event.c: Still send idle events when receiving SDL joystick events, fixing possible joystick issues
main/menu.c: No referring to non-existent ogl_maxanisotropy for non-OGL build
main/kconfig.c, main/newmenu.c, ui/mouse.c: Fix cursor recentering issues - comment out redundant event_toggle_focus(1) calls in kconfig.c and newmenu.c and use event_toggle_focus(0) in ui_mouse_show()
arch/ogl/ogl.c, main/gauges.c: Before duplicating last pixel column or row in ogl_filltexbuf, make sure we are still in actual bitmap boundaries; Incrementing defines SHIELD_GAUGE_Y, SHIP_GAUGE_Y for HIRESMODE to fit these gauges pixel-correct in Cockpit mode
SConstruct, d2x-rebirth.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj, editor/centers.c, editor/eswitch.c, editor/med.c, editor/medrobot.c, editor/medwall.c, editor/mine.c, editor/objpage.c, editor/texpage.c, include/editor/editor.h, include/editor/objpage.h, include/editor/texpage.h, include/ui.h, ui/button.c, ui/checkbox.c, ui/dialog.c, ui/file.c, ui/gadget.c, ui/icon.c, ui/inputbox.c, ui/keypad.c, ui/keypress.c, ui/keytrap.c, ui/listbox.c, ui/menu.c, ui/message.c, ui/popup.c, ui/radio.c, ui/scroll.c, ui/userbox.c: Rename ui/window.c to ui/dialog.c to avoid confusion with arch/sdl/window.c, also rename UI_WINDOW to UI_DIALOG, rename all associated functions, constants, parameters, local variables etc too; make a window when making a UI_DIALOG (does nothing yet)
SConstruct: opengles variable in SConstruct could be activated by command-line argument opengl
main/terrain.c texmap/ntmap.c, texmap/scanline.c: Fixing memory corruptions produced by the scanline renderer; Dynamically allocate y_pointers to free scanline renderer from resolution limits

20110116
--------
2d/bitblt.c, arch/ogl/gr.c, arch/ogl/ogl.c, include/ogl_init.h, main/menu.c: Added feature to enable Anisotropic filtering is supported by hardware or driver; Reworked way of handling texture filtering information so ingame switching is possible again
main/menu.c: When changing resolutions and Game_wind is present, send EVENT_WINDOW_ACTIVATE shortly so it's canvase will align to the new resolution seamlessly
main/titles.c: For more consistency to original game, show descent(b).pcx before pilot selection if available; Generally use PATH_MAX for filename arrays in titles code
main/console.c, main/inferno.c: Toggle console by KEY_SHIFTED+KEY_ESC again - as it should be
arch/ogl/ogl.c: in ogl_filltexbuf add pixel row matching color of bitmap edge to get a clean border when filtering cockpit overlay bitmaps

20110115
--------
arch/linux/ipx.c, main/net_ipx.c: Fixed some compiler warnings
main/game.c: Due to recent changes in event_poll() game_handler() must call ReadControls() for EVENT_MOUSE_MOVED, too; Little fix for FixedStepCalc()
arch/ogl/gr.c, arch/ogl/ogl.c: Fixed alpha limit for ogl_ulinec(), gr_uricle(), gr_disk()

20110114

arch/include/event.h, arch/include/key.h, arch/include/mouse.h, arch/sdl/event.c, arch/sdl/key.c, arch/sdl/mouse.c, editor/med.c, include/ui.h, main/automap.c, main/credits.c, main/escort.c, main/gamecntl.c, main/inferno.c, main/inferno.h, main/kconfig.c, main/kmatrix.c, main/menu.c, main/movie.c, main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c, main/newmenu.c, main/scores.c, main/titles.c, ui/file.c, ui/keypress.c, ui/menu.c, ui/menubar.c, ui/message.c, ui/mouse.c, ui/popup.c, ui/window.c: For editor, replace use of ui_mega_process() with event_process(), with the editor's own default event handler; add EVENT_MOUSE_MOVED event with event_mouse_get_delta() accessor; add event_key_get() to replace ugly casting; rename mouse_get_button() with event_mouse_get_button() to keep with name convention; only send idle events when there are no input events so editor still works properly (or the same anyway); add and use event_send() function for input events (including idle)
main/fireball.c, main/gamesave.c, main/multi.c, main/multi.h, main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c, main/object.c, main/object.h: Fixing code used for capping powerups in multiplayer - it was not correctly conting 4pack powerups; Cleaned up this code a bit and added more consistent naming convention for functions to maybe make it more understandable; Removed MULTI_PROTO_D2X_VER define as it's not needed
main/gamesave.c, main/multi.c, main/object.h: In multi_leave_game check for Player_eggs_Dropped before actually dropping to prevent multiple drops in case player quits game after being killed; put console output level of multiplayer powerup cap messagers to CON_VERBOSE
main/gameseq.c: Using timer_query() instead of clock() in InitPlayerPositions(); Also decreasing check value for closest_dist to D1-level to actually make it less likely to start at total random unchecked location where another player could be
main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c: When displaying kill goals in game rules, value must be multiplied by 5 to show the correct limit
main/collide.c, main/multi.c, main/multi.h, main/net_udp.c: Added feature to optionally disable friendly fire in Team and Coop games
main/newmenu.c: Moved scroll arrow one unit to the left to be not pixel-aligned to possible checkbox; Made newmenu sliders only react to spacebar, backspace, left and right since pageup/down is already taken for menu scrolling and all other previous key assignments will not work on most spread keyboard layouts
include/console.h, main/console.c, main/gamecntl.c, main/gamerend.c, main/inferno.c, main/kmatrix.c, main/movie.c, main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c: Converted console into a window and allow it to show in every part of the game; Fit several poll functions and kmatrix so they won't get interrupted by the console

20110111
--------
main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c: Fixed Menu setting for AllowedItems which was broken due to changed return value of newmenu_do1

20110110
--------
2d/disc.c, arch/ogl/gr.c, arch/ogl/ogl.c, include/gr.h, include/ogl_init.h, main/automap.c, main/gamerend.c, main/gauges.c, main/gauges.h, main/menu.c, main/playsave.c, main/playsave.h: Added different reticle types with RGBA and size settings; Apply RGBA and size to FlightSim Indicator and Guided Crosshair; Added Brightness Slider to Graphics options menu; Added OpenGL usage for gr_disk
main/credits.c, main/songs.c, misc/hmp.c: Let credits track fade out at the end of text sequence; Fixed usage for RBAPlayTracks - when playing only one track last must be equal first, not 0; In hmp_open changed data from long to int, preventing memory explosion depending on optimisation of the code
arch/sdl/timer.c: In timer_update() convert cur_tv to fix scale before substracting from last_tv to get more accurate values to F64_RunTime (insignificant tho); Added rollover check for SDL_GetTicks() to timer_delay2()

20110109
--------
main/net_udp.h: Set max UDP packet size to 1024 again (seems some configuration DO have problems with larger packets after all)
main/net_udp.c: Fix for rev968: my_pnum must be defined static
arch/sdl/digi.c, inlcude/hmp.h, misc/hmp.c: Improvement on the HMP track loop feature by TURRICAN; Added small template fix for descent.hmp which is supposed to be activated soon as we have some kind or Checksum function
main/kconfig.c: Mousebutton assigned to CYCLE SECONADARY was actually calling CYCLE PRIMARY

20110106
--------
main/multi.c, main/state.c: Fixed but in object to object_rw conversion - if a bot is not dead, leave dying_start_time at 0 as anything else would kill it
3d/rod.c, SConstruct, arch/ogl/gr.c, arch/ogl/ogl.c, include/3d.h, include/ogl_init.h, main/gamecntl.c, main/object.c, main/state.c, misc/args.c: Added OpenGL ES support - contributed by Florian Feucht and Oliver Haag
main/automap.c, main/gauges.c, main/gauges.h: Draw FlightSim Reticle on Automap display, too; Fixed small glitch showing Vulcan/Gauss ammo in alt hud mode on all cockpit modes instead of CM_FULL_SCREEN only
arch/ogl/ogl.c: Fix small bug in vertex_array for ogl_ubitblt_i

20110104
--------
d2x.ini, include/args.h, main/gauges.c, main/inferno.c, main/kconfig.c, main/kconfig.h, main/menu.c, main/playsave.c, main/playsave.h, misc/args.c: Introduced FlightSim control scheme for mouse which adds delta values to absolute position to behave like a Joystick; Added Deadzone slider for FlightSim as well as an optional Reticle display to show the positional data on screen; Removed old Mouselook hack in favor of this new feature

20110103
--------
arch/sdl/joy.c, arch/sdl/key.c, arch/sdl/mouse.c, include/args.h, main/kconfig.c, main/kconfig.h, main/playsave.c, misc/args.c: Saving  weapon keys in PLX like in D1X-Rebirth; Added Cycle Primary/Secondary for Mouse which makes wheel axis cycling unnecessary and also let Weapon Keys be assigned to a Mouse button; If GameArg.NoStickyKeys do flush these keys so they can be used as normal game keys - otherwise ban them; Fixed crash when reassigning mouse button greater than 3; Joystick/Mouse function taking button as argument now check for sanity of this value so they can safely be used in kconfig code and deal with unassigned key values
d2x.ini, include/args.h, main/gamerend.c, main/hud.c, main/inferno.c, main/menu.c, main/multi.c, main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c, main/playsave.c, main/playsave.h, misc/args.c: Moved NoRedundancy, MultiMessages and NoRankings toggles from GameArg to PlayerCfg to be set via Misc Options
SConstruct, INSTALL.txt: More consistency in SConstruct command-line variables; Added automatic Endianess-checker; Set target to 'd2x-rebirth' no matter if OpenGL or not

20110102
--------
main/credits.c, main/kconfig.c, main/menu.c, main/net_udp.c, main/newmenu.c, main/scores.c: Increasing general mouse functionality all over the game: Mouse wheel now can scroll through menu/listbox items; Right mouse button closes a menu (without the need of these ugly close boxes); Also added mouse-closing capabilities to credits, scores and kconfig menus; While being in UDP Netgames list, override keycode at PAGEUP/DOWN keypress to only flip pages without modifying citem also added messagebox showing TXT_INVALID_CHOICE when invalid netgame was chosen
arch/include/key.h, arch/sdl/key.c, main/newmenu.c, main/credits.c: Introduced function key_ismodlck to get the status of modifier keys or sticky keys; Let sticky keys survive flush so we can accurately use their real states; Added key repeating via SDL; Depending on status of KEY_NUMLOCK keypad will either be used as numerical or arrow input in menus; Fixed small typo for mouse.h include in credits.c

20101230
--------
main/newmenu.c, main/menu.c: Fixed glitch in scroll arrow position; Added newmenu_scroll which can scroll through all kind is menu structures including automatically handling NM_TYPE_TEXT items as well as automatically updating scroll_offset; PageUp/Down now scrolls by 10 items, Home/end will select first/last/items of menu creating consistency to listbox behaviour; Fit text for GrabInput to be more understandable

20101228
--------
d2x-rebirth.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj, editor, include/editor, main/editor, SConstruct: Move main/editor to editor and move headers to include/editor, like d1x
editor/info.c, editor/med.c, include/editor/editor.h, include/editor/info.h: Make the keypad info display into a window
arch/include/event.h, arch/include/joy.h, arch/include/mouse.h, arch/sdl/event.c, arch/sdl/joy.c, arch/sdl/mouse.c, d2x.ini, include/args.h, main/automap.c, main/config.c, main/config.h, main/game.c, main/gamecntl.c, main/inferno.c, main/kconfig.c, main/menu.c, main/newmenu.c, main/playsave.c, main/playsave.h, misc/args.c: Added Sensitivity/Deadzone menu with sliders for each movement based action seperated for joystick and mouse to support all kinds of configuration - regardless the amount of joystick axes and whatnot; SDL_WM_GrabInput does not only capture mouse but also focus keyboard input - changed code to respect this fact and made grabbing a menu option which is enabled by default

20101224
--------
d2x-rebirth.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj, include/ui.h, main/editor/centers.c, main/editor/editor.h, main/editor/group.c, main/editor/medrobot.c, main/editor/medwall.c, main/editor/mine.c, main/editor/texpage.h, main/gamesave.c, main/gamesave.h, main/switch.c, main/switch.h, ui/button.c, ui/checkbox.c, ui/func.c, ui/harderr.c, ui/keytrap.c, ui/medfunc.c, ui/menubar.c, ui/mouse.c, ui/radio.c, ui/ui.c, ui/window.c: Copy some editor stuff from d1x-rebirth to d2x-rebirth, like use of the OS native cursor
arch/carbon/conf.h: Disabling IPv6 support for OS X since in Snow Leopard it's buggy, making all Multiplayer pretty much impossible - re-activating soon as proper patches from Apple are in sight

20101223
--------
main/net_udp.c, main/net_udp.h: Reworked object sending/receiving to work without unnecessary type casting and a bit less error prone; Also increased UDP max packet size to 2048 so we can send 7 objects per frame; Fixded joinign games - GameID was sent for full game info, not lite info
main/credits.c: Align timer_delay for credits so the song (midi or redbook) should at least be heard once

20101222
--------
arch/sdl/window.c: In window_close() prev window did not get EVENT_WINDOW_ACTIVATED but the recent closed window got it causing previous window not being activated anymore and a bunch of memory errors
arch/ogl/ogl.c, include/ogl_init.h, main/ai.c, main/ai.h, main/ai2.c, main/aipath.c, main/aistruct.h, main/cntrlcen.c, main/collide.c, main/controls.c, main/escort.c, main/fuelcen.c, main/game.c, main/game.h, main/gamecntl.c, main/gameseg.c, main/gameseq.c, main/gauges.c, main/laser.c, main/lighting.c, main/mglobal.c, main/multi.c, main/multi.h, main/multibot.c, main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c, main/newdemo.c, main/object.c, main/object.h, main/player.c, main/player.h, main/powerup.c, main/state.c, main/weapon.c: Made GameTime to GameTime64 using fix64; Changed all structures saving GameTime64 for internal timer purposes to store fix64 and added converting functions to save such times in fix; For Savegames/Demos always reset GameTime64 to 0 while saving and putting all timer values to safe limits, Multiplayer objects are sent in similar fashion
d2x-rebirth.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj, main/menu.c, main/editor/med.c, ui/file.c: Activate EDITOR for Mac OS X in Xcode, d2x target; fix some warnings and errors
main/collide.c, main/object.c, main/object.h, main/state.c: added hitobj_list to struct laser_info to get a bit cleaner code
main/gamecntl.c, main/gamesave.c: Fix warning for deliberate GameTime64 wrap; change GameTime to GameTime64 for editor
main/multi.h, main/net_udp.c, main/net_udp.h: in IPv6 builds also send regular broadcast packets to get games found via LAN between IPv4 clients/systems and IPv6 clients/systems; rather than identifying (lite_info) games via IP use randomly generated GameID and game name to prevent duplicated coming from IPv6 builds
ui/window.c: Put event_process() in ui_mega_process(), getting editor to (mostly) work

20101211
--------
arch/include/key.h, arch/include/mouse.h, arch/sdl/event.c, arch/sdl/joy.c, arch/sdl/key.c, arch/sdl/mouse.c, arch/sdl/rbaudio.c, arch/sdl/timer.c, include/maths.h, include/timer.h, include/ui.h, main/automap.c, main/console.c, main/digiobj.c, main/editor/medrobot.c, main/editor/medwall.c, main/fireball.c, main/game.c, main/inferno.c, main/kmatrix.c, main/laser.c, main/laser.h, main/lighting.c, main/menu.c, main/multi.c, main/multi.h, main/multibot.c, main/net_ipx.c, main/net_ipx.h, main/net_udp.c, main/net_udp.h, main/newmenu.c, main/scores.c, main/titles.c, ui/listbox.c, ui/mouse.c, ui/scroll.c, ui/window.c: Introduced new data type fix64 to be used for new timers which can last 4462756 years instead of 9 hours; Introduced new timer functions to update and query program time; Used new timer all over the program except GameTime (which comes next)

20101205
--------
arch/carbon/messagebox.c, arch/include/window.h, arch/linux/messagebox.c, arch/sdl/key.c, arch/sdl/mouse.c, arch/sdl/window.c, arch/win32/messagebox.c: Add CON_DEBUG level con_printf's for basic events (not EVENT_IDLE or EVENT_DRAW though)

20101204
--------
main/bmread.c, main/piggy.c: Set a bogus sound when a sound is skipped in gamedata_read_tbl and don't let piggy_close free it
main/gamecntl.c: When calling do_game_pause do not allocate msg in Game mod GM_MULTI as it's not used nor freed
include/pstypes.h: Changed another WIN32 to _WIN32 to avoid accidentially compiling with WORDS_BIGENDIAN when using VisualC

20101203
--------
main/net_udp.c: Made resent_delay for net_udp_noloss_process_queue() a bit longer depending on the player's ping

20101130
--------
include/hmp.h, misc/hmp.c: Little fixes for rev950 - changed definition from WIN32 to _WIN32, added little hack for incorrectly set HMP loop in Descent2-version of descent.hmp
SConstruct, arch/include/messagebox.h, arch/win32/messagebox.c, main/inferno.c, misc/error.c: Add support for Windows native error/warning boxes; Only print to stdout on Linux/other *nix; Fixed redundant printing of Error and Warning via stdout
arch/carbon/messagebox.c, d2x-rebirth.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj: Add missing stuff to get it to build on Mac OS X; turn fullscreen off when showing a messagebox for Mac
main/inferno.c: When Quitting is called in standard_handler disable Autodemo if active

20101128
--------
main/multi.c: In multi_new_game when initializing Players structures, also correctly init connected variable which is highly important for spreading pdata to clients and should be set correctly anyways (Thanks to Gold Leader and Flip for help with debugging/testing recent Multiplayer bugs)
main/powerup.c: in do_powerup added check for distance of other players to powerup object to make redundant pickups less likely
arch/carbon/messagebox.c, arch/include/messagebox.h, arch/linux/messagebox.c, arch/sdl/rbaudio.c, arch/win32/messagebox.c, d2x-rebirth.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj, main/editor/med.c, main/game.c, main/inferno.c, SConstruct: Add support for OS native error/warning boxes, only implemented for Mac for now
SConstruct: Added missing brackets gone missing in r936
arch/sdl/digi.c, arch/sdl/digi_mixer_music.c, include/hmp.h, main/digi.h, main/songs.c, misc/args.c, misc/hmp.c: Large improvement for _WIN32 native MIDI code by TURRICAN: supprt for HMP track loop, seamless song looping, GS reset, pausing/resuming midi, volume control for each MIDI channel; Set GameArg.SndDisableSdlMixer automatically if compiled without SDL_mixer support; On _WIN32 play HMP natively again

20101126
--------
include/physfsx.h, main/inferno.c, misc/physfsx.c: Implemented PHYSFSX_checkSupportedArchiveTypes to check if essential archive types are supported. Print warnings if not and stop program if necessary. Also added PHYSFSX_listSearchPAthContent  to print out search path contents (figures) each time the function is called. Doing this before main HOG inits as well after sucessfully adding archives. Made PHYSFSX_addArchiveContent a bit more verbose as well.
main/console.c, main/inferno.c: If -verbose or -debug is set, write gamelog.txt unbuffered for a higher chance to get messages there in case of a crash; Totally supress messages in stdout/err.txt on _WIN32

20101125
--------
main/net_udp.c: When adding data from net_udp_send_mdata_direct to noloss queue, use data_len as length of data stream - not len which is longer and would then cause storing garbage

20101123
--------
main/net_udp.h: reducing max buffer size of an UDP packet from 1024 to 576 bytes - should prevent possible turncating, especially when sending obejcts where max size is actually used
main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c: When verifying objects, do not necessarily check for controlcen as it's not necessarily there in some anarchy missions

20101122
--------
arch/sdl/jukebox.c: Make sure read_m3u won't read past the end of the buffer, causing a crash
main/inferno.c: If it can't find descent2.hog/d2demo.hog, still print some useful info

--------
arch/sdl/jukebox.c, include/physfsx.h, main/menu.c, misc/physfsx.c: Created function PHYSFSX_isNewPath to check wether given path has already been added to Searchpath or not; Used PHYSFSX_isNewPath for menu browsing code instead it's own implementation; Using PHYSFSX_isNewPath for Jukebox directory, too to make sure Jukebox will not accidentially remove Game content depending on user selection; Also only keep Jukebox directory added until files are stored to prevent any other file present in this path can override or add anything to the game
main/config.c: For fresh configuration set Redbook music as default for Mac, Builtin music for all others
main/hud.c: When checking for redundant messages in HUD display, compare new message to most recent one for locking and check whole list only for messages marked with HM_REDUNDANT. This will show all messages in correct order while keeping redundancy-prone messages from looping infinitely

20101109
--------
main/multi.c: In DropOrb PLAYER_FLAGS_FLAG-bit was not removed before calling multi_send_flags which would draw the HUD-box even if player ejected all Hoard orbs

20101101
--------
main/newmenu.c: In case listbox strings are too long for screen, fit box width to screen width, shorten strings and add a scroll effect to selected item

20101030
--------
main/titles: Make songs playing at end briefings loop, like they used to in the original game
main/menu.c: Text string for level music was made smaller some time ago so BROWSE_TXT_SHRT basically became obsolete - removed it now and show BROWSE_TXT instead

20101029
--------
arch/sdl/digi_mixer_music, include/hmp.h, misc/hmp.c: Instead of writing converted MIDI to file, write to buffer so it can be played directly

misc/physfsx.c: fullpath variable was missing for _WIN32

20100919
--------
main/state.c: Pass -1 instead of 255 as the colour to ogl_ubitmapm_cs when drawing savegame previews, to make sure a black rectangle isn't drawn instead
iff/iff.c, main/titles.c: To fix Dravis's head in endgame debriefing, don't remap the colours and read compressed .bbm bitmaps properly (both my bad)

20100904
--------
main/titles.c: In briefing_init() init robot angles properly because in show_spinning_robot_frame() robot_angles.h is incremented only but not initialized
main/game.c, main/game.h, main/gameseq.c, main/state.c: Removed Fusion_last_sound_time and made Fusion_next_sound_time static inside FireLaser() with it's own fallback function for bogus timer values - should make this code insusceptible against errors - last but not least: minus two globals

20100903
--------
main/game.h, main/gameseq.c, main/state.c: Reset Fusion_next_sound_time in init_player_stats_level() to hopefully fix Fusion not doing damage or playing sounds 

20100902

main/gamecntl.c, main/menu.c, main/newdemo.c, main/newdemo.h: Using PHYSFSX_findFiles to make sure random demo playback will only find actual demo files and not quit autodemo; added DEMO_EXT for an universal definition of demo file extension
arch/sdl/digi_mixer_music.c: When opening music file via filehandle, made sure buffer is freed after playing to prevent major memory leakage

20100901
--------
main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c: in pdata communication swap_bytes was set for create_shortpos causing problems on PPC architecture; in multiplayer host menu set citem to START GAME by default

20100831
--------
include/u_mem.h, main/menu.c, main/newmenu.c, main/newmenu.h: Added feature to let select_file_reursive() change drive on _WIN32 via CTRL-D; Removed second definition of MEM_K accidentially happened due to bad communication

20100828
--------
main/menu.c: In list_dir_el make sure PHYSFS_getRealDir won't give NULL to strcmp which will happen for files located in a Windows root directory

--------
main/mission.c, main/mission.h, main/titles.c: Overhauled detection of TEX/TXB files for Briefings and Endings

20100823
--------
main/songs.c: For Redbook, play the credits track after the title track like original Descent 2 did

20100822
--------
main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c: Moved levelnum-sanity-check in game_param_handler so it will be checked when screen is changed to allow entry of secret levels (which does not work in D2X-Rebirth - it's only done for code similarity); added menu item START GAME for consistency and added proper subtitle for game setup page
arch/sdl/digi_mixer_music.c: Use more reliable Mix_LoadMUS for music in directory searchpaths, so WAVE's and MP3's are correctly loaded (probably others)

20100821
--------

main/gamecntl.c: Removed processing of HandleVRKey() as this code is not usable anymore and blocks some system keys (removal of general VR-code will follow later)
main/songs.c, arch/sdl/digi_mixer_music.c, arch/sdl/rbaudio.c, arch/sdl/digi.c: For each Music playback system defining own volume scaling definition which was wrong for SDL_mixer

20100817
--------
main/digi.h, main/menu.c, main/songs.c, main/songs.h: Renamed MUSIC TYPE options BUILT-IN MUSIC to BUILT-IN/ADDON MUSIC and CUSTOM MUSIC to JUKEBOX; Removed LEVEL-DEPENDENT play order for Jukebox as this is now mainly covered by AddOn packs and future M3U-support

20100816

INSTALL.txt: Updated docs to add new OGG Soundtrack created by Brandon Blume
main/inferno.c: Moved up PHYSFSX_addArchiveContent() a little inside main() so -debug and -verbose will show us this content which will be helpful for debugging possible problems with AddOn Zips

20100815
--------
INSTALL.txt, include/physfsx.h, main/inferno.c, misc/physfsx.c: Added support to automatically load/mount ZIP files at startup, giving option to dynamically override or replace game content; Updated docs

20100814
--------
main/game.c: Tidy up for EVENT_IDLE case in game_handler, hopefully fixing obscure 'optimise threads' bug

20100811
--------
main/laser.c: The inital vector scaling to compensate previous frame-skipped tracking was not aligned to FrameTime. Removed that code and just divided homer_turn_base values to compensate this offset properly. Thanks to zif for hinting me to that; Added comment about the how and why of the homing missile scaling issue

20100809
--------
d2x-rebirth.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj, include/physfsx.h, include/pstypes.h, misc/physfsx.c, SConstruct: Add 'Resources' in .app bundle to searchpath for Mac; move bigger functions from physfsx.h to physfsx.c; resolve conflict with definition of 'bool'

arch/sdl/event.c: Between event sending, exit event_process if front window is different, fixing netgame joining problem introduced with commit on 20100731

20100803
--------
main/hud.c: When updating redundant HUD messages check the for-loop not the start with a negative number - causes too long message display and negative array index

20100801
--------
main/menu.c, main/songs.c, main/songs.h, main/gameseq.c, main/digi.h, arch/sdl/digi.c: Builtin music list now dynamically allocated and not limited to 30 songs; Instead of never loading new level when loading savestate ingame, only do this for Redbook and Custom Music playing order 'continously'; if no endlevel song is specified in Custom Music continue with level music
arch/sdl/mouse.c: If mouse_toggle_cursor is set to activate, do not toggle ursor visibility as mouse_update_cursor_and_grab might decide it should be hidden
main/automap.c, main/text.h: Fixed automap marker info as well as misleading text defines

20100731
--------
main/gamepal.c, main/gamerend.c, main/inferno.c, main/kmatrix.c, main/menu.c, main/newmenu.c, main/newmenu.h, main/scores.c: For polling newmenus, set rval using a pointer and don't delay closing the window, hopefully fixing bad memory access when clicking in level scores screen; change newmenu_close to newmenu_free_background to avoid confusion

20100730
--------
main/game.c: Removed leftover of mouse grabbing from set_screen_mode - forgot to do this in rev1192
SConstruct: restricted parsing of sdl-config to *NIX and Mac builds as it's static on Win32 anyways; added verbosebuild as SCons option to print out all compiler/linker messages
main/state.c, main/game.c, arch/sdl/event.c, arch/sdl/mouse.c, arch/include/event.h: Added event_flush to take place in game_flush_inputs which will clean SDL events which may be buffered while event_process was suspended; suspend Game_Wind while loading restoring save state while playing a level to properly flush controls and reset timer; when toggeling cursor, also directly modify the mouse to wanted behaviour instead of waiting for mouse_update_cursor_and_grab

20100729
--------
main/automap.c, main/cntrlcen.c, main/game.c, main/gamecntl.c, main/gameseq.c, main/menu.c, main/movie.c, main/newmenu.c: Tidy up use of set_screen_mode
arch/ogl/gr.c, arch/ogl/ogl.c: Using rather sane values for gluPerspective - fixing Z-Fighting bugs on Intel chips; in Fullscreen toggle, always apply new viewing values independent of Screen_mode

20100728
--------
main/automap.c, main/game.c, main/gamecntl.c, arch/sdl/init.c, arch/sdl/mouse.c, arch/include/mouse.h: One more take on Mouse cursor friendliness: Merged mouse_toggle_cursor and mouse_toggle_grab; instead of trying to use SDL_GetAppState (which does not work as expected on Windows) to release mouse, use strict calls of mouse_toggle_cursor so we at least have a free mouse outside of Game_wind and Automap; decreased time to automatically hide cursor; added mouse_close to release mouse in case of emergency

20100727
--------
2d/pcx.c, include/pcx.h, main/cntrlcen.h, main/fuelcen.h, main/gameseq.c, main/kmatrix.c: Show stars background for died in mine and secret level messageboxes; equalise fuelcen.h and cntrlcen.h
arch/sdl/mouse.c: Fixing automatic mouse release function - still this does not seem to work in every case
misc/hmp.c: Fixing bug in MIDI header - format was written in size of int instead of short
arch/sdl/digi_audio.c, arch/sdl/digi_mixer.c, main/config.c: Moved digi_set_digi_volume call from config loading to designated audio subsystem init function so it will be correctly set after the sound system is auctionlly initialized

20100726
--------
arch/sdl/event.c, arch/sdl/mouse.c: Overhauling showing/grabbing cursor and also taking care of case if program looses focus; store old_delta_x/y in mouse info structure

20100725
--------
arch/sdl/event.c, arch/ogl/gr.c, arch/sdl/gr.c: Exit SDL_PollEvent early if window changes, to avoid menu problems when pressing keys fast; fix 'condition is always false' warning 
main/inferno.c, main/inferno.h, main/movie.c: Rewrite quit system, fixing *many* bugs with it :P
main/newmenu: For menus, only call the user function for closing immediately before closing, fixing memory errors when the user function frees memory
main/newmenu.c: Fix crash caused by last commit (whoops)

20100721
--------
main/net_udp.c: Fixing crash when joinging game over UDP Netlist: when exiting the menu for any reason, return 0 instead of following the code and possibly lead to drawing text from a newly free'd pointer - D'OH! 

20100720
--------
main/net_udp.c: Thanks to Marix for hinting me I should not init a pointer with quotes if I plan to allocate/free it... my stupid-level officially broke the record

20100719
--------
misc/hmp.c: Did not close hmp after MIDI conversion which caused some unfree memory - fixed
main/gameseq.c, main/state.c, main/state.h: Introduced state_quick_item so we can safly check if there is a valid quicksave slot wihtout messing around with state_Default_item which is supposed to always show a valid slot in the first place
main/titles.c: In briefings make sure Current_color cannot exceed possible array bounds
include/strutil.h, main/newdemo.c: Fixing some harmless compiler warnings caused by missing includes, missing newlines at end of file; cleaned up strutil.h
arch/win32/ipx.c: Removed redundant Winsock calls from Windows-specific IPX code - it's already in net_ipx.c

20100718
--------
SCsonstruct, d1x-rebirth.xcodeproj, arch/sdl/digi.c, arch/sdl/digi_mixer_music.c, include/cfile.h, include/hmp.h, include/hmp.c: Merged all HMP-related code into hmp.c/h; Also introduced new HMP to MIDI conversion functions based on JJFFE which use former Win32-related HMP-code - fixes some bugs in MIDI conversion and cleaner

20100717
--------
main/render.c: Fix overlapping room in D1 lvl19 by moving vertex a little. Still a hack
main/gameseg.c, main/render.c: Instead of screwing by possibly using negative array indicies in find_seg_side() return -1. In ordering segments make this result in unimportant order; Taking in some Asserts which were disabled years ago by me. Let's fix this for real when we get to it
arch/sdl/digi_audio.c: For normal digital audio (11/22Khz) use buffer of 1024 for all platforms to prevent delay

20100716
--------
main/gamecntl.c: Fixing showing options menu in demos - was still called (or rather not) by obsolete variable
main/newmenu.c, main/newmenu.h, main/automap.c, main/game.c, main/kconfig.c, arch/sdl/event.c, arch/sdl/joy.c, arch/sdl/init.c, arch/sdl/key.c, arch/sdl/mouse.c, arch/include/mouse.h: Only use one single call of timer_get_fixed_seconds() for whole SDL event loop; Abstracted grabbing mouse and mouse cursor toogle to mouse functions instead of calling SDL functions inside of non-arch code; Automatically hide mouse cursor if it's not used for more than 3 seconds; Reworked placement of mouse grabbing toggle; Do not read any mouse input if -nomouse is given
main/newdemo.c: If newdemo_start_playback fails if random file is given set -autodemo to 0 to prevent endless loop

20100715
--------
main/object.c, main/wall.c, main/newdemo.c, main/newdemo.h, main/gauges.c: Cleaned the variables used for newdemo code; Instead of giving both old and new values to special recording functions, added new variables to demo code serving this purpose and also checking for redundant record calls which only would waste bytes; Removed duplicated-object-id-hack which did not work as expected and caused jittering on playback; In that process, found a bug where Num_open_doors might nor be set correctly - cleaned that up a little and got also rid of one aweful goto; Made sure cloaked walls are recorded FPS-independent but rather fade-value-dependent
main/titles.c: Scale tab stops in briefings to font-size correctly
main/titles.c: Make sure the right canvas is set for titles and briefings, fixing bug where briefing is shown in the cockpit when using 'freespace' cheat

20100713
--------
include/args.h, main/net_udp.c, main/collide.c, main/multi.c, main/inferno.c, main/object.c, main/gamepal.c, main/wall.c, main/state.c, main/hud.c, main/weapon.c, main/hostage.c, main/hudmsg.h, main/newdemo.c, main/switch.c, main/net_ipx.c, main/gameseq.c, main/escort.c, main/fuelcen.c, main/endlevel.c, main/powerup.c, main/automap.c, main/game.c, main/gauges.c, main/kconfig.c, main/gauges.h, main/gamecntl.c, misc/args.c, d2x.ini, arch/ogl/gr.c, arch/sdl/jukebox.c: Added expandable classes for HUD messages (like D1X but slacked) to better handle Multi messages or redundant messages; Rewrote HUD code completely; Changes -playermessages to -multimessages since this is more appropriate; Removed remnants of -mprofile

20100709
--------
main/mission.c, main/titles.c: When reading mission file, check for sanity of possible breifing or ending to make sure author did not just screw up the file; Fixed slight bug when playing ending briefings from secret levels
main/laser.c: Trying to improve reliability to find appropriate homing object by using vm_vec_mag/normalize instead of their *quick equivalents

20100708
--------
main/net_udp.c, main/net_udp.h: Reworked handling of Netlist now also showing full game info; Prevent Clients from sending lite_info; Make lite_info show numconnected instead of numplayers as this would show disconnected ones as well; Removed reusing ports on different instances in Windows build - only screws up several games running on one machine
main/game.c, main/gameseq.c, main/multi.c, main/net_udp.c, main/net_ipx.c: Improved hanlding for closing sockets - doing via closing of Game_wind when available or in specific multi menus; Also handling GM_GAME_OVER setting over Game_wind closing as well if apprpriate - cleaner and helps to cleanup multi when mission is over
arch/sdl/key.c: Also send event KEY_COMMAND if there's somethig in our Unicode buffer since not every Unicode key corresponds to a keysym on every layout 
README.txt: Fixing typo

20100705
--------
main/kconfig.c: Fixing issue when assigning mouse button if a citem is still pointed out; Fixing still processing key commands even if we want to assign a key; After setting mouse button, reset mouse state properly
arch/sdl/digi_mixer_music.c: Fixing issue introduced in rev1139: Game could of course not open music files which are not inside Searchpath or added to it - re-added playing over absolute path
main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c: When selecting coop game mode, make sure that besides max players menu values also actual player number is set and menu text is updated properly
main/net_udp.h: Reducing sending objects per frame from 20 to 1 again to reduce possibility of timeout on stressed systems
main/songs.c: Fixing building on Windows if SDL_Mixer is not a target

20100704
--------
SConstruct: Fixing Windows build which was not linking against SDL
main/net_udp.c: Fixed Compiler-warning on Windows
main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c: Implemented Winsock functions for UDP which I totally forgot about; Now when leaving game in any way, close sockets and Winsock stuff
main/gameseq.c, main/multi.c: Since time is not suspended between levels in Multiplayer, call reset_time after level change. Apply this in Singleplayer, too since it should always be safe - and appropriate - to reset timer_value soon as a new level begins
main/net_udp.c: Fixes for rev1148: Was too hasty with calling net_udp_close; Fixing typo in WSACleanup()

20100701
--------
2d/font.c: For gr_get_string_size introduced get_char_width_f to calculate with floats to measure non-integer font scalings; Cleanup
main/net_udp.c, main/newmenu.c: Renamed manual_join to direct_join; Aligned letlist tabs a little bit

20100630
--------
main/gameseq.c: If multi_level_sync() fails, restart menu music since level music is playing already
main/game.c, main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c, main/newmenu.c, main/newmenu.h, main/weapon.c: Removed SurfingNet global and made tabs a parameter of newmenu_dotiny; Same procedure with MenuReordering which is replaced with newmenu_doreorder to set reordering flag specifically
main/net_udp.c: Always try to open UDP default port when discovering Netgames and give warning if that fails; If entered IP address cannot be resoled, do not warn me twice

20100629
--------
main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c: Aligned default width for IPX-Netlist menu to fit possible items a bit better; Fixed two small bugs when sending and receiving lite_info in UDP; Allowed broadcast on UDP sockets (for later use)
main/menu.c, main/new_udp.c, main/net_udp.h: Added UDP Netlist to join LAN games discovered/announced via broadcast
main/net_ipx.c, main/net_udp.c: Improved handling of multi level sync and exit smoothly back to the menus; Fixed another small bug in lite_info broadcasting which was sending full info; By broadcasting full info, host could cripple Netgame so a new security measure is implemented to protect host from letting his game be overwritten from outside

20100627
--------
main/game.c, main/game.h, main/gameseq.c: When starting, leaving or changing a level in any way, use more ordered approach to set Game_wind visible or invisible. Fixing timer-issues after level-change and makes hiding of Game_wind obsolete for certain messageboxes; Moved GameTime and weapon timer variables out of reset_time since this function is not appropriate for this and is not needed between levels anymore due to window management handling start/stop_time properly
arch/sdl/digi_mixer_music.c, main/jukebox.c: For playing music over SDL_mixer always use handle over PhysFS to save the path building mess; When building Jukebox path, only try to build full path if given path is actually a child of Searchpath

20100625
--------
main/titles.c: Made Briefing printing sound apply everytime there is chattering enabled. Even if it would be logical to have it only with flashing cursor, most briefings - even Counterstrike - forget to toggle it correctly

20100624
--------
arch/ogl/gr.c, arch/sdl/gr.c, include/gr.h, main/menu.c: Added function to list valid resolutions and build resolutions menu dynamically with the resulting list
main/gamecntl.c: When inregulary exiting a level by warp cheat, suspend Game_wind and reactivate again after the switch

arch/ogl/ogl.c: Deactivated depth writing fo g3_draw_bitmap() sprites to prevent rendering errors when clipped in some cases

20081122
--------
main/kconfig.c: Completly forgot to make mouse axis values static so they can be used in intervals - shame on me!
main/fvi.c, main/pysics.c: Took out the "disable_new_fvi"-hack. After all we do not need that specific optimisation anymore and also without it we can have more accurate collisions with non-player objects. After playtesting for a while let's just do this.

20081121
--------
main/gamecntl.c, main/gauges.c: Do not allow to restore games while player is dead... again - to much trouble right now; Solving small display issue when fading out weapons which ran out of ammo

20081118
--------
main/console.c: When printing Gamelog, make sure canvas is NULL
main/newmenu.c, main/multi.c, main/automap.c, main/gamecntl.c, ui/inputbox.c, ui/menubar.c, arch/sdl/event.c, arch/sdl/key.c, arch/include/key.h: Yet another UNICODE overhaul - Using seperate buffer for UNICODE chars and only use it in key_ascii() while still using keysyms for the rest of the program so we do not screw up readings by key values altered by modifers - possibly still room to optimize
main/gamecntl.c: Fixed cheats!
main/automap.c: Changed keys for Automap Viewing Distance to F9/F10 - Minus/Equal is not Layout independent

20081115
--------
arch/sdl/digi_audio.c: include/error.h, main/console.c, main/inferno.c: Added other SDL_(Un)LockAudio statements to protect the audio_mixcallback function - making that hopefully stable on multicores; Resetting warn_func at quit_request so we do not accidently show any menu; Open gamelog.txt unbuffered

20081114
--------
include/args.h, include/3d.h, include/rle.h, include/rbaudio.h, main/text.c, main/text.h, main/bm.c, main/gamefont.c, main/inferno.c, main/bm.c, main/bmread.c, main/piggy.c, main/render.c, main/render.h, main/songs.c, main/gameseq.c, main/gamerend.c, main/netdrv.c, main/endlevel.c, main/endlevel.h, main/terrain.c, main/terrain.h, main/polyobj.c, main/polyobj.h, main/game.c, main/gauges.c, main/texmerge.c, main/mission.c, main/mission.h, main/gamecntl.c, misc/args.c, 2d/rle.c, 3d/setup.c, SConstruct, D2X.make, arch/linux/alsadigi.c, arch/ogl/gr.c, arch/sdl/digi_mixer.c, arch/sdl/joy.c, arch/sdl/init.c, arch/sdl/rbaudio.c, arch/sdl/gr.c, arch/sdl/key.c, arch/sdl/digi_audio.c, arch/include/mouse.h: Using a clean flow for closing game data at the end of main() instead of using atexit; Now only use atexit for SDL stuff, error, mem, console (and editor which we do later); Small Cleanup

20081110
--------
main/credits.c, main/inferno.c, main/menu.c, main/newmenu.c: Small Cleanup: Using timer_delay for credits timer as timer_delay2 would respect VSync and change speed of the Credits scrolling; Cleaned that Start/Join Netgame cases up a bit; Removed the excessive use of atexit in newmenu... more to come
misc/error.c: When Error() is called, set Function_mode to FMODE_EXIT... basically to prevent the messagebox would try to render the game in background if the Error would happen while mission loading

20081109
--------
include/args.h, include/gr.h, main/gamefont.c, main/inferno.c, main/menu.c, main/gamerend.c, main/gauges.c, main/gauges.h, misc/args.c, d2x.ini, arch/ogl/ogl.c, arch/ogl/gr.c: Always keep aspect scaling (lowest scalar of width and height) for fonts, lines, dots, spheres, reticle and non-Cockpit-/Statusbar-related HUD-elements; Moved the Cockpit alpha decoding to gauges.c and created a seperate bitmap for the alpha fields and create subbitmaps from this one - more memory but this way we do not modify the cockpit bitmap itself

20081107
--------
arch/sdl/key.c: Only read UNICODE values from 31 to 254 to make sure we do not read any non-printable characters and prefer the keysym that way; Added left and right Command Key for MAC Keyboards

20081103
--------
misc/args.c: Fixed Typo
main/ai2.c, main/collide.c: Made move_towards_segment_center() use move_towards_vector() instead of just changing object position suddenly - smoother; Changed back the robot:controlcen collision back to original - the AI just relies to often on no-damage collisions, especially when our segment suddenly is a controlcen

20081101
--------
main/config.c, main/menu.c, main/newmenu.c, main/piggy.c: Fixed possible overflows in Jukebox Path; Menu GUI improvements: Correct inputbox scaling for font widths, a little performance boost when determinating string-part to show in inputbox, make it possible to flip over from first/last menu entry to last/first even if it's a ScrollBox, Scrolling via Maousebutton now works with delay; Made reading for Piggy data always break up in loops when reached end of file instead of provoking possible error if *data-count < max-data-count*
arch/sdl/key.c: Make sure that if we use UNICODE, we always take non-control type chars and - as we only want lowercase letters - convert chars if shift is pressed
arch/ogl/ogl.c. main/game.c: I always forget glLineWidth takes previous setting if arg is <1; Made the decodebuffer for cockpit static as the bitmap data pointer points to it

20081031

arch/ogl/ogl.c: Make glLinewidth depend on screen height, not width (for Widescreen monitors) (commit came with last revision, sorry)

20081030
--------
INSTALL.txt, README.txt: Docs update: Infos about Jukebox over SDL_mixer, SDL_mixer is not experimental anymore, yet another .de->.com change

2d/font.c, main/gamefont.c, main/gamefont.h, main/menu.c: Scale fonts by float values and filter them if texture filtering is on; Another fix for the code flow in change_res() as the check for minimal custom resolution always failed
main/collide.c: Yet another check for collide sounds as FixedStep is not necessarily true if the actual collision happens
main/newmenu.c: Cast LINE_SPACING to integer for menu Scrollbox usages - fixing scrolling issues with non-integer-scaled font sizes

20081028
--------
arch/ogl.c, include/gr.h, main/game.c, main/gamerend.c, main/gauges.c, main/gauges.h, main/newmenu.c: Removed hack for Cockpit-window transparencies and added function to decode and add alpha to the bitmap directly (now works in non-OGL as well); Using sub-bitmaps for Cockpit-windows and menu backgrounds; Cleaned old bkg stuff from menu GUI
main/gamerend.c, main/manu.c, main/newmenu.c: Fixes for my last revisions: More reliable check for cockpit_decode_alpha, more reliable check is newmenu sub-bitmap needs to be re-created, call gr_set_mode() in change_res() with correct Game_screen_mode
INSTALL.txt, README.txt: Docs update: We moved from www.dxx-rebirth.de to www.dxx-rebirth.com!
