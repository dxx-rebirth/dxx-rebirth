  <description>
      <p>D2X-Rebirth is a modern port of the Descent 2 game engine, based on the late D1X and D2X source ports (which, in turn, were based on the original Descent source and LDescent).
        The Rebirth Team has spent a lot of time working to improve the source code by fixing old bugs and adding some improvements, while always staying true to our philosophy:
        <em>Keep it Descent!</em>
      </p>
      <p>DXX-Rebirth has every little feature you may remember from the original Descent 1 &amp; 2 and much more. For example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Full compatibility with Descent and Descent 2, including all expansions and third-party levels.</li>
        <li>DXX-Rebirth runs on your favourite Operating System. We officially support Linux (and other *NIXs), Mac OS X and Windows. The source code can also be compiled on many other systems!</li>
        <li>OpenGL provides fast and smooth rendering - even on low-end systems.</li>
        <li>Optionally you can enable several effects like Transparency, Colored Lighting, Texture Filtering, FSAA, etc.</li>
        <li>Thanks to SDL, a wide variety of Joysticks are supported. Also you can use more Joysticks, buttons and axes than you can ever operate in your state of evolution.</li>
        <li>Joystick, Keyboard and Mouse can be used simultaneously.</li>
        <li>The games can display all resolutions and aspects supported by your monitor, including an option for VSync.</li>
        <li>Besides MIDI and CD-Audio (Redbook), you can play your own custom Music from your hard drive or a separate AddOn.</li>
        <li>Both games can utilize special AddOn packs to replace or expand the original game content.</li>
        <li>Multiplayer via UDP protocol provides a fast and easy-to-use LAN and Online action. This includes reliable communication causing less glitches due to lost packets.</li>
        <li>The ingame Demo-recording system has been improved. Demos are less glitchy and smaller while still still being backwards-compatible to earlier versions of the games.</li>
        <li>Higher game speed will not cause glitches such as unacceptable fast homing projectiles, incredible high damage caused by several collisions or Fusion cannon, etc.</li>
        <li>Player files, Savegames, Demos and Missions from DOS-Versions of the games can freely be used in DXX-Rebirth and vice versa.</li>
        <li>Mac Command keys are now working - see F1 Help. Command-Q works much like a normal Mac program</li>
        <li>Multiplayer support over UDP/IP (using port 42424 by default)</li>
        <li>Even more ...</li>
      </ul>
