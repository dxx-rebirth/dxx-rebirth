Special notes for this release
------------------------------
* HMP files are now converted to MIDI on the fly. The game will not create MIDI files in the "music" subdirectory anymore. So if you have no need for this directory and it's contents, feel free to delete it.
* Due to changes in handling of weapon cycling with the Mouse you might need to reconfigure these mappings
* Compiling the source via SCons will now automatically check for Endianess
* Available SConstruct options have changed! See 'scons -h' for more information.
* On *NIX (Linux, BSD, etc.) the game binary will be called 'd1/2x-rebirth' and on Windows the executable is called 'd1/2x-rebirth.exe'. No -gl or -sdl suffixes anymore. If needed, correct your Desktop shortcuts, start scripts, etc.
* The Tracker server is brand new and might still have a bug or two. If you encounter a bug, let us know so we can properly fix it. Most can be fixed without a modification on the game itself.


Known issues
------------
* On Windows the mouse is not correctly released if using ALT+TAB to minimize the game. This is not a bug in the program but rather the SDL library. It can be worked around by pausing the game and using ALT+ENTER to get the game to windowed mode. The mosue should not be stuck then anymore
